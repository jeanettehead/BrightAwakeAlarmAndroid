		\nNotes about this early version of the alarm clock:\n\n
The volume the alarm will play at is the volume you have set for your alarms.  You can adjust this settings -> sounds -> volumes.\n\n

The snooze is hard coded to be 5 minutes.\n\n

This is the first version - intentionally without any fancy features.  If you encounter a bug, please tell me and include what device and what version of android you\'re using :)\n
